# üåç Cybersecurity Earth Simulator

A fun 3D project that simulates what cyber attacks might look like on Earth and has some quizzes to learn about cybersecurity. This is just for education and visualization - no real attacks happening here!

## What it does

- Simulates cyber attack animations on a spinning Earth
- Has interactive quizzes about phishing, ransomware, etc.
- Has DDoS Lab for simulating DDoS attacks and learning how to prevent and defend against them.
- Everything is simulated/educational, not real data

## How to run it

Start a local server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then press `Q`, `W`, `E`, or `R` to try different simulations.
